# Bitwise Operators
Bitwise Operators in C++
Bitwise operators in C++ allow direct manipulation of individual bits within integer data types. These operators are commonly used in low-level programming, graphics, cryptography, and performance-critical code where operations on bits are essential.

List of Bitwise Operators
Operator	Symbol	Description	Example
AND	&	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	a & b
OR	|	Sets each bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1	`a
XOR	^	Sets each bit to 1 if only one bit is 1	a ^ b
NOT	~	Inverts all the bits (one's complement)	~a
Left Shift	<<	Shifts bits left, filling with zeros	a << 2
Right Shift	>>	Shifts bits right, filling with zeros	a >> 2
